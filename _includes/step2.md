<strong>modeling_main.R</strong> is used to define the input and call all these steps. The inputs are pre-poplulated with the default values created for a VM from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery.  You must  change the values accordingly for your implementation if you are not using the default server (<code>localhost</code> represents a server on the same machine as the R code). If you are connecting to an Azure VM from a different machine, the server name can be found in the Azure Portal under the "Network interfaces" section - use the Public IP Address as the server name.

The steps to create and evaluate the model are described in detail on the <a href="data-scientist.html">For the Data Scientist</a> page. Open and execute the file <strong>modeling_main.R</strong> to run all these steps.  You may see some warnings regarding <code>strptime</code> and <code>rxClose</code>. You can ignore these warnings.

After executing this code, you can examine the ROC curve for the Gradient Boosted Tree model in the Plots pane. This gives a transaction level metric on the model. 

The metric used for assessing accuracy (performance) depends on how the original cases are processed. If each case is processed on a transaction by transaction basis, you can use a standard performance metric, such as transaction-based ROC curve or AUC. 

However, for fraud detection, typically account-level metrics are used, based on the assumption that once a transaction is discovered to be fraudulent (for example, via customer contact), an action will be taken to block all subsequent transactions.

A major difference between account-level metrics and transaction-level metrics is that, typically an account confirmed as a false positive (that is, fraudulent activity was predicted where it did not exist) will not be contacted again during a short period of time, to avoid inconveniencing the customer.

The industry standard fraud detection metrics are ADR vs AFPR and VDR vs AFPR for performance, and transaction level performance, as defined here:

* ADR â€“ Fraud Account Detection Rate. The percentage of detected fraud accounts in all fraud accounts.
* VDR - Value Detection Rate. The percentage of monetary savings, assuming the current fraud transaction triggered a blocking action on subsequent transactions, over all fraud losses.
* AFPR - Account False Positive Ratio. The ratio of detected false positive accounts over detected fraud accounts.

You can see these plots as well in the Plots pane after running <strong>modeling_main.R</strong>
